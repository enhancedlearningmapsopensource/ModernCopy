As a teacher, I also used the sequence the textbook suggested - graphing, substitution, and elimination in that order and in isolation. I recognized that it didn\'t work very well, but I couldn\'t ever come up with something better. The research that suggested this problem solving approach without the use of variables (initially) was eye opening and I am SO glad it worked with your students! Thank you for trying something out of the ordinary and for providing feedback on how it went. We appreciate it SO much.</p> <p>Lindsey</p>')
